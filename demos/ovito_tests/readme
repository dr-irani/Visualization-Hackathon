Tests for generating 3D stereoscopic images and videos using POV Ray and Ovito. Current workflow:

1) Load data in Ovito (https://ovito.org/index.php/download) 
Ovito is designed to render the atomic simulation data but can be used to render the trajectory of any type of discrete particles. 
It accepts many dataformats, can customize various visual features, and has an associated python library.

2) Install POVRay 3.7.1 (http://www.povray.org/)
Need to download the developmental version (https://github.com/POV-Ray/povray/releases)
Ovito can use several engines to render the data,POV Ray in particular has support for 360 steroscopic views

3) Render an mp4 video

4) Inject 360 metadata using google app (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en)

5) Upload on youtube or open in VLC
